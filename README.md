# PET-VTT

This repository contains Pan-European TIMES-VTT (abbreviated PET-VTT) energy system model compiled with The TIMES (The Integrated MARKAL-EFOM System) model generator developed by IEA-ETSAP.
PET-VTT is developed by Technical Research Centre of Finland Ltd and is based on JRC-EU-TIMES by Joint Research Centre of the European Commission © European Union, 1995-2019, CC BY 4.0., available at https://data.jrc.ec.europa.eu/collection/id-00287 
Changes to the original model have been made: List of changes are introduced in a separate changelog file, and changes are marked with color coding to the database.

The work was funded by the financial support for the green transition by the European Union (number 151, P5C1I2, NextGenerationEU, project REPower-CEST) and EU H2020 (project NEGEM, 869192.

The database contains one scenario to begin your own work with. The scenario is labelled as 'EUnetzero', as it includes a net zero CO2 emission assumption for the year 2050 for the aggregate EU region. 

Note that the scenario is not an EU reference scenario, and is not a ready decarbonisation scenario for the EU. It is intended purely as a starting point for your own scenario modelling.
